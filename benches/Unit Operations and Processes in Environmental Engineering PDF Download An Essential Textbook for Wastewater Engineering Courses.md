Unit operations and processes are fundamental concepts in environmental engineering that involve the physical, chemical, and biological treatment of various environmental systems. They are essential for designing, operating, and optimizing environmental engineering facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, air pollution control systems, solid waste management systems, and hazardous waste remediation systems. Unit operations and processes can be classified into four categories: transport processes, equilibrium processes, kinetic processes, and reactor analysis.
 
There are many online resources that provide information on unit operations and processes in environmental engineering. Some of them are:

Some examples of unit operations and processes in environmental engineering are:

1. **Fluid flow:** This involves the movement of fluids such as water, air, and gases through pipes, channels, pumps, valves, and other devices. Fluid flow is important for transporting and distributing fluids in environmental engineering systems, as well as for controlling the pressure, velocity, and flow rate of fluids. Fluid flow also affects the performance of other unit operations such as sedimentation, filtration, and membrane separation.
2. **Sedimentation:** This involves the separation of solid particles from a liquid by gravity. Sedimentation is commonly used for removing suspended solids from wastewater, stormwater, and drinking water. Sedimentation can also be enhanced by adding chemicals (coagulation and flocculation) or by applying external forces (centrifugation and flotation).
3. **Filtration:** This involves the separation of solid particles from a liquid by passing the liquid through a porous medium. Filtration is widely used for removing fine solids, microorganisms, and organic matter from water and wastewater. Filtration can be classified into different types based on the pore size of the medium (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis) or based on the driving force of the liquid (pressure-driven, vacuum-driven, or gravity-driven).
4. **Membrane separation:** This involves the separation of solutes or molecules from a liquid by using a selective membrane. Membrane separation is an advanced technology that can achieve high-quality water treatment and recovery. Membrane separation can be classified into different types based on the mechanism of separation (diffusion-driven, pressure-driven, electrically-driven, or thermally-driven) or based on the membrane configuration (flat-sheet, hollow-fiber, tubular, or spiral-wound).
5. **Absorption:** This involves the transfer of a gas or a dissolved substance from one phase to another by contacting them with a liquid or a solid. Absorption is commonly used for removing pollutants from gas streams or liquid streams. Absorption can be enhanced by using chemical reactions (chemisorption) or by increasing the contact area (packed columns, spray towers, or wet scrubbers).
6. **Adsorption:** This involves the accumulation of a gas or a dissolved substance on the surface of a solid. Adsorption is often used for removing organic compounds, metals, and odors from water and wastewater. Adsorption can be influenced by various factors such as temperature, pressure, pH, and adsorbent properties. The most widely used adsorbent in environmental engineering is activated carbon.
7. **Distillation:** This involves the separation of a liquid mixture into its components by vaporizing and condensing them at different temperatures. Distillation is mainly used for producing potable water from seawater or brackish water (desalination). Distillation can also be used for recovering valuable solvents or chemicals from waste streams.
8. **Crystallization:** This involves the formation of solid crystals from a solution by changing the temperature, concentration, or pH. Crystallization is often used for recovering salts or minerals from brines or wastewater. Crystallization can also be used for removing hardness or scaling from water.
9. **Aeration:** This involves the introduction of air or oxygen into a liquid to increase its dissolved oxygen content. Aeration is essential for aerobic biological processes such as activated sludge and trickling filters. Aeration can also be used for oxidizing iron and manganese in groundwater or for stripping volatile organic compounds from contaminated water.
10. **Biological treatment:** This involves the use of microorganisms to degrade organic matter or transform pollutants in water or wastewater. Biological treatment can be classified into different types based on the oxygen requirement (aerobic, anaerobic, or anoxic), the growth mode (suspended growth or attached growth), or the reactor configuration (batch or continuous).
