Eptar Reinforcement is a solution that helps designers to draw documents and lists the necessary reinforcement for their buildings in ArchiCAD. The application provides tools to define all 2D drawings as well as complete 3D models. The solution contains a library of different reinforcement objects and an Add-on. They provide great freedom in defining constructions and also help to specify complex objects[^2^].
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Eptar Reinforcement for ArchiCAD 15, which is compatible with ArchiCAD 15 version or higher[^3^]. We will cover the main features of the solution, such as automatic reinforcement of slabs, roofs, walls, columns and beams, custom rebar and stirrup forms, cutting list generation and more.

## Automatic Reinforcement of Slabs
 
Eptar Reinforcement can automatically reinforce straight, slanted and curved slabs with mesh and rebar elements. You can also reinforce slab edges and holes with shear rebars. To use this feature, you need to select a slab element and choose Reinforcement > Automatic Slab Reinforcement from the menu bar. A dialog box will appear where you can set the parameters of the reinforcement, such as mesh type, rebar diameter, spacing, offset, cover and more. You can also choose to reinforce only selected edges or holes. After clicking OK, the reinforcement will be placed on the slab element.
 
## Automatic Reinforcement of Roofs
 
Eptar Reinforcement can also automatically reinforce roofs with mesh and rebar elements. You can reinforce complex roofs and multiply roof surfaces as well. To use this feature, you need to select a roof element and choose Reinforcement > Automatic Roof Reinforcement from the menu bar. A dialog box will appear where you can set the parameters of the reinforcement, such as mesh type, rebar diameter, spacing, offset, cover and more. You can also choose to reinforce only selected edges or planes. After clicking OK, the reinforcement will be placed on the roof element.
 
## Automatic Reinforcement of Walls
 
Eptar Reinforcement can automatically reinforce walls with rebar elements. You can also reinforce wall edges and openings with shear rebars. To use this feature, you need to select a wall element and choose Reinforcement > Automatic Wall Reinforcement from the menu bar. A dialog box will appear where you can set the parameters of the reinforcement, such as rebar diameter, spacing, offset, cover and more. You can also choose to reinforce only selected edges or openings. After clicking OK, the reinforcement will be placed on the wall element.
 
## Automatic Reinforcement of Columns and Beams
 
Eptar Reinforcement can automatically reinforce columns and beams with rebar and stirrup elements. You can also define complex elements with custom profiles and shapes. To use this feature, you need to select a column or beam element and choose Reinforcement > Automatic Column/Beam Reinforcement from the menu bar. A dialog box will appear where you can set the parameters of the reinforcement, such as rebar diameter, spacing, offset, cover and more. You can also choose to define a complex element with a custom profile and shape. After clicking OK, the reinforcement will be placed on the column or beam element.
 
## Custom Rebar and Stirrup Forms
 
Eptar Reinforcement allows you to create custom rebar and stirrup forms that suit your design needs. You can use polygonal forms or predefined forms that are most commonly used in practice. To use this feature, you need to choose Reinforcement > Rebar/Stirrup from the menu bar. A dialog box will appear where you can draw or select a form for your rebar or stirrup element. You can also set the parameters of the element, such as diameter, length, angle and more. After clicking OK, the element will be placed on your cursor and you can place it anywhere in your project.
 
## Cutting List Generation
 
Eptar Reinforcement can generate cutting lists for your reinforcement elements that show their ID numbers, types, diameters, lengths and quantities. You can also export these lists to Excel or PDF formats for further processing. To use
